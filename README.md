## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This module is still in developement, but will ease the process of creating filler content to help developers build and test their programs. 

## TODO <a name = "todo"></a>
- Method to **create paragraphs** using different phrase structuring
- Method to incorporate various **code injection** (sql, bash, etc) techniques for vuln testing (*no malicious injections included*)
- Method to **create random JPG** using numpy arrays, with specifiable size
- Method to **create binary and bytecode** which can be interpreted without error

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on any system.


## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

This is in early dev, so its still pretty straight forward. </br> See [deployment](#deployment), and get a 6 digit number using `soupgenerator.Text.number(6)`

## 🚀 Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

We're still doing a lot of testing, so currently the best way to deploy is to simply drop the soupgenerator.py file into your project file, make sure you add the csv files from /libs to your project also. </br> Then you just `import soupgenerator`
